# EVE Preview Manager

EVE Preview Manager — Yet another EVE-O-Preview clone for Linux, written in Rust. A reimplementation of my older [EVE-L_Preview](https://github.com/h0lylag/EVE-L_Preview). Inspired by [EVE-O-Preview](https://github.com/Proopai/eve-o-preview), [EVE-X-Preview](https://github.com/g0nzo83/EVE-X-Preview), [Nicotine](https://github.com/isomerc/nicotine), and [eve-l-preview](https://github.com/ilveth/eve-l-preview).

## Status

This is project is under active development and should be working. Keep in mind it's primarily designed around my own workflow and environment on NixOS. I built this for myself first and foremost. I will try to provide binaries for people to run but I don't have extensive testing infrastructure in place to test all edge cases. You can always try building it from source if you have issues.

## Features

- Real-time thumbnail previews of all EVE client windows
- Click thumbnails to activate windows or drag to reposition
- Hotkey-based character cycling with configurable key bindings
- Customizable thumbnail appearance including size, opacity, fonts, colors, and borders
- Profile-based configuration system for managing multiple setups
- One-click character import for cycle groups
- Optional features: cycle through logged-off clients, auto-minimize inactive windows, position inheritance for new characters

## Requirements

- Linux x86_64 with X11 (Wayland users: works via XWayland)
- User must be in `input` group for hotkey detection (`sudo usermod -aG input $USER`) - Requires re-logging to take effect
- Runtime dependencies: OpenGL, fontconfig, dbus, libxkbcommon (should already be installed on most modern Linux distributions)

## Installation

### NixOS

Add the repo to your flake inputs:
```nix
{
  inputs.eve-preview-manager.url = "github:h0lylag/EVE-Preview-Manager";
}
```

Then add it to your packages:
```nix
environment.systemPackages = [ 
  eve-preview-manager.packages.${pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.system}.default
];
```

cd eve-preview-manager-*-x86_64
chmod +x ./eve-preview-manager
./eve-preview-manager
```

### Build from Source
