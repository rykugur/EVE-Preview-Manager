# EVE Preview Manager

[Website](https://epm.sh) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/MxdW5NCjwV) | [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/com.evepreview.manager) | [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/eve-preview-manager)

EVE Preview Manager - Yet another EVE-O-Preview clone for Linux, written in Rust. A reimplementation of my older [EVE-L_Preview](https://github.com/h0lylag/EVE-L_Preview). Inspired by [EVE-O-Preview](https://github.com/Proopai/eve-o-preview), [EVE-X-Preview](https://github.com/g0nzo83/EVE-X-Preview), [Nicotine](https://github.com/isomerc/nicotine), and [eve-l-preview](https://github.com/ilveth/eve-l-preview).

## Features

- Real-time thumbnail previews of all EVE client windows
- Per-character and cycle group hotkeys with configurable key bindings
- Customizable thumbnail appearance including size, opacity, fonts, colors, and borders
- Profile-based configuration system for managing multiple setups
- One-click character import for cycle groups
- Optional features: cycle through logged-off clients, auto-minimize inactive windows, position inheritance for new characters, disable thumbnails altogether

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Run `eve-preview-manager` (or `flatpak run com.evepreview.manager`). It starts in GUI mode and creates a system tray icon.
2. **Manage Profiles**: Use the GUI to create specific profiles for different activities (e.g., PvP, Mining). You can add, remove, or duplicate profiles to quickly switch between setups.
3. **Configure Display Settings**: Customize the look and feel of your thumbnails, including size, opacity, fonts, borders, and colors to match your preferences.
4. **Set Up Hotkeys**: Configure hotkeys to cycle between clients in your active group.
5. **Manage Characters**:
   - **Add Characters**: Click the "Add" button to include EVE characters in your cycle group. Active and previously detected clients will appear in the popup.
   - **Manual Entry**: Alternatively, switch to "Text Editor" mode to manually paste a list of character names (one per line).
   - **Individual Hotkeys**: Once added to the cycle group, you can bind specific hotkeys to individual characters for direct access.
6. **Save & Apply**: Click "Save & Apply" to save your current configuration and refresh the previews.
7. **Swap Profiles**: Swapping profiles can be done quickly by right-clicking the system tray icon and selecting the desired profile.

**Note**: Configuration is stored in `~/.config/eve-preview-manager/config.json`.

## System Requirements
- **Required:** OpenGL, fontconfig, dbus, libxkbcommon, libxcb (standard on most distros).
- **Recommended:** Wayland (via XWayland). Native X11 environments are supported but users may experience issues with preview overlays fighting for Z-order and incorrect image offsets.
- **Optional:** If using evdev instead of x11 hotkeys, you will need to add your user to the `input` group. Not recommended unless you know what you're doing.
